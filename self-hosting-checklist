BUG: Seems like we forget to numbrervars for :- declrations.

self-hosting checklist:
	[/] maplist/n [TODO - TEST!]
	[/] is/2: <<, +
	[ ] :- use_module(library(readutil), [read_file_to_terms/3]).
	[/] :- use_module(library(gensym), [gensym/2]).
	[/] arg/3
	[ ] ->/2 (probably need to replace call with generator-style for this...)
		- could also just replace in src pretty easily to get to self-hosting faster.
		- wait this is easy... i can just do comptime only for now.
			- or replace with a cond or if_ predicate
			- (you DO need ancestral cuts to implement rt version b/c u need to cut parent ;/2).
		- also tempted to break compat with swi so cut behavior is simpler...
		- WAIT A MINUTE -- you can use "parent cut" as an effect, right??
			- like, maybe cut is the return value...
		- yeah ok the key insight is actually that only cuts
			that bubble up as *returns* should be handled here.
			- so that means callee changes are minimal
	[/] \=
	[ ] numbervars/3
	[/] numlist/3
	[/] functor/3 (still need to test...)
	[/] memberchk, member
	[ ] format/3 (only some cases)
		- e.g. format(string(Message), "Failed to compile clauses: ~w", [X])
	[ ] string/1 var/1 and other value typecheckers (types.ts)
	[/] throw
	[	] domain_error(rule_or_directive, Message)
	[ ] phrase/2 (both list concatenation and for calling dcgs)
	[ ] string_codes/2
	[ ] atomics_to_string/2
	[ ] atom_string/2
