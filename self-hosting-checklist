BUG: Seems like we forget to numbrervars for :- declrations.

self-hosting checklist:
	[ ] is/2: <<, +
	[ ] :- use_module(library(readutil), [read_file_to_terms/3]).
	[/] :- use_module(library(gensym), [gensym/2]).
	[/] arg/3
	[ ] maplist/n
	[ ] ->/2 (probably need to replace call with generator-style for this...)
		- also tempted to break compat with swi so cut behavior is simpler...
		- WAIT A MINUTE -- you can use "parent cut" as an effect, right??
			- like, maybe cut is the return value...
		- yeah ok the key insight is actually that only cuts
			that bubble up as *returns* should be handled here.
			- so that means callee changes are minimal
	[/] \=
	[ ] numbervars/3
	[/] numlist/3
	[/] functor/3 (still need to test...)
	[/] memberchk, member
	[ ] format/3 (but only for var_name_...)
		- format(string(Message), "Failed to compile clauses: ~w", [X])
	[ ] string/1 var/1 and other value typecheckers
