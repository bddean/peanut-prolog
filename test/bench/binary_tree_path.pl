% Binary tree pathfinding benchmark
% ---------------------------------
% A small synthetic benchmark that exercises unification and back-tracking
% but keeps list operations to a minimum.
%
% We build a complete binary tree of depth 5 using plain edge/2 facts
% (only ~30 facts so it stays tiny).  `path/3` explores the graph
% depth-first, producing a list that represents a route between two
% arbitrary nodes.
%
% The search space is large (every internal node has two children) but we
% ask for a *single* leaf, so the engine still needs to explore a fair
% amount of failing alternatives before it finds a solution.  That puts
% some load on choice-point creation and unification, which is exactly
% what we want to benchmark.
%
% The lists we do use (`[X|P]`) are short (â‰¤ depth 5) and therefore do
% not dominate run-time, honouring the current limitation that list
% operations are unoptimised.
